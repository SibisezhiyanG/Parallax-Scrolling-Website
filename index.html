        <p>
            A parallax scrolling website uses a visual technique where background elements move at a different speed than foreground elements as you scroll. This creates an illusion of depth and motion, making the page feel more dynamic and immersive.
            Instead of everything moving together, layers shift at different rates‚Äîlike trees sliding past faster than mountains in the distance when you're in a moving car. This effect draws attention to key content and adds a sense of storytelling to the design.

             ‚ú®Why Use Parallax Scrolling?
        </h2>
        <p>
            1. Visual Depth : It gives your site a 3D-like feel without needing complex graphics. <br>
            2. User Engagement : Movement keeps visitors curious and encourages them to scroll further. <br>
            3. Creative Storytelling : You can guide users through a journey, section by section. <br>
            4. Modern Aesthetic : It adds a sleek, interactive vibe that feels fresh and professional.
        </p><br>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">üõ†Ô∏è How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling is usually achieved with a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You define different layers‚Äîlike background images, midground visuals, and foreground text‚Äîand control how each one moves as the user scrolls.
            For example : <br>
            - Background moves slowly <br>
            - Foreground moves faster <br>
            - Middle layers
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">üåêParallax Scrolling Website ‚Äì All Layers Explained</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling creates a depth illusion by moving different visual layers at different speeds while scrolling. Here's a breakdown of each layer and its role:</p><br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">Background Layer :</h3>
        <p>The background layer is the deepest visual component and sets the stage for the entire parallax experience. It typically scrolls the slowest or remains fixed, giving the illusion of vast distance. This layer often features expansive imagery‚Äîlike sky gradients, galaxies, mountains, or abstract visual fields‚Äîthat establish the site‚Äôs mood and theme. It is crucial that this layer remains visually soft and subtle so it doesn‚Äôt overpower the more interactive or content-heavy layers above. It serves a purely atmospheric role, helping to immerse users without requiring interaction or direct attention.</p><br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">Midground Layer :</h3>
        <p>Sitting between the background and foreground, the midground layer introduces more visual complexity and dimension. It scrolls at a moderate speed, and its purpose is to enhance depth perception, making the website feel layered and dynamic. Midground elements often include semi-detailed visuals like treetops, clouds, city buildings, or layered textures that move gently to give the sense that they‚Äôre closer than the distant background. These elements may interact with foreground objects in subtle ways, often using transparency, blur, or lighting effects to transition smoothly between spatial layers.</p><br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">Foreground Layer :</h3>
        <p>The foreground layer lies closest to the user‚Äôs perspective and moves at a faster scroll rate compared to the background and midground. It contains detailed or animated elements that capture attention and often form part of the site‚Äôs interactive storytelling. This layer might include floating illustrations, decorative graphics, objects, or thematic props that move across the screen as users scroll, making the experience more immersive and tactile. Because this layer is more visually prominent, careful design is needed to ensure it adds value and doesn't clutter the visual hierarchy.</p><br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">Content Layer :</h3>
        <p>This is the most functional and essential layer‚Äîwhere the actual content lives. The content layer includes all user-facing information such as text, headings, buttons, calls-to-action, images, and links. It usually scrolls at a normal rate, unaffected by parallax speed variations, or remains fixed for clarity. This layer must prioritize usability, accessibility, and responsiveness, ensuring users can navigate, read, and interact with the site effectively. While parallax effects add visual appeal, they should never interfere with the clarity or behavior of this layer, which carries the primary message and purpose of the site.</p><br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">Overlay Layer (Optional) :</h3>
        <p>The overlay layer is an optional but powerful design tool placed above all other layers. It‚Äôs typically used for stylistic enhancements or atmospheric effects and rarely contains functional elements. Examples include semi-transparent color gradients, light leaks, floating particles, weather effects like snow or rain, or soft vignettes that help guide the viewer's focus. This layer can remain static, move subtly, or interact lightly with scroll events. The key role of the overlay layer is to unify the visual tone, polish the experience, and subtly elevate the visual storytelling without drawing focus away from the core content.</p><br>
        
        <h2 id="about" style="color: rgb(46, 211, 230);">About :-</h2>
        <p>This project is created purely for educational purposes to demonstrate the basic structure and functionality of a parallax scrolling website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually shows how multiple layers‚Äîbackground, midground, foreground, and content‚Äîmove at different speeds during scrolling to create a 3D-like depth effect. <br>
        The HTML file provides a semantic structure for the page, including a header, parallax section, content explanation, and footer. CSS is used to control layout, positioning, and visual layering, while JavaScript adds scroll-based animations that make the elements dynamically move and scale as the user scrolls. <br>
        This website also includes built-in explanations of each layer's role, helping viewers understand both the effect and the technique. The project is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and ideal for learning modern web design fundamentals. <br>
        It was developed by Sibisezhiyan, Developer Trainee, under the guidance of Laufrel, Chennai.</p>
